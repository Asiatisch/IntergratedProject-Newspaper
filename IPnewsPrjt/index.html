                <h5><span>4:42 pm</span> - Feburuary 17, 2022</h5>
                <h6>Japan will accept Ukrainian refugees who have fled to other countries because of the ongoing conflict in their country, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has revealed.</h>
                    <p>Japan said Wednesday it will temporarily close its embassy in Kyiv as Russia's invasion of Ukraine escalates, with many civilians desperately fleeing the country.
                        The embassy's operations will be transferred to a temporary liaison office set up in Lviv in western Ukraine, according to the Foreign Ministry.The office, 
                        located near the border with Poland, will continue to provide support to Japanese citizens living in Ukraine, including those trying to evacuate from the country, 
                        the ministry said.The decision to close the embassy on Wednesday was announced after Russia's military said it would strike Ukrainian communications and intelligence 
                        sites in Kyiv, warning residents near them to leave. On Tuesday, Russian forces fired at the main television tower in the Ukrainian capital, killing at least five people.
